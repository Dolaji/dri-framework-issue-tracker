# dri-framework
The dri-framework project has in goal to provide a fully functional FiveM roleplay server with advanced and highly developed features.  
All development is done by me (Dolaji/Mayank/BB). No development will be rushed, making sure it is done properly and thoroughly. I expect to push regular updates introducing new features, bug-fixes, and balancing changes.  
DRI-FW is written in Lua, but HTML, CSS & JavaScript is also used a lot for the UI.
